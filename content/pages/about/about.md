This is the [[digital garden]] of Till Gartner. I'm a simple guy with simple hobbies, like

- My **family** and **kids**
- My business (I'm a manager in a really cool software company called [**mgm technology partners**](https://mgm-tp.com))
- Some **sport**: Skiing, running, swimming, climbing.
- Some **programming** (even though by now I rather manage IT than code): Play around with stuff that is new to me. 
- Even thow I don't really cook (there is no point trying to compete with my wife! ðŸ¥°), I collect some [recipes](/recipes).

Find me on <a href="https://x.com/tillg" target="blank" style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle;"><img src="x.svg" alt="X" width="20" style="display: inline; margin: 0 3px; vertical-align: middle;"/></a> or <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tillg/" target="blank" style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle;"><img src="instagram_icon.png" alt="Instagram" width="20" style="display: inline; margin: 0 3px; vertical-align: middle;"/></a>.

[These](/todo/) are the things I plan to do in my Digital Garden.
