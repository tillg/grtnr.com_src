Title: Beyond Vibe coding - Redesigning Filmz
Date: 2025-05-21

summary: Some time ago I built a little iOS App called Filmz with _vibe_coding_. Turns out that's nice until you end up _vibe debugging_. So now I take a new attempt, starting in a more structured way.

Some time ago I built a little iOS App called Filmz: keep track of films and shows you want to see or you have seen. Keep personal additional information like "how did I like it?" (I.e. my personal rating), "For what audience would I recommend it?" (Adults, kids, family) "When and where did I see it" etc. And then comes sharing: passing on film recommendations to friends, either one film at a time or lists.

As I didn’t know any Swift back then, I built it in a _vibe coding_ style, fully supported by AI (back then mainly Cursor.ai). This gave me a fast start, but I was lost once I wanted to add more complex features that required a well structured code base. And since I didn’t know much about Swift, I couldn’t do it either. Vibe debugging doesn’t work - yet…

So here I start again, and with a different approach: I will try to work in a similar way as I would with a smart but junior peer developer. The focus will be on a stepwise approach, followed along with a proper documentation: Descriptions of the task at hand, description of the architecture changes, of the options that were inspected / thought of and what was chosen why...

[I worked with my AI friend ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/share/68371708-8a44-8009-b424-059b920feec9), and plan to start with a structure as described below.

2025-05-28: I take this as a starting point, work, and see what's missing. And add the missing bits on the way.
