---

Every couple of years you get the opportunity to setup a new Mac. It's typically a enjoyable process, yet it eats up some time. In order top make it a _structured_ enjoyable process, here is my note to future-me of what I have to install, and in what order.

- [Basic](#basic)
- [For work](#for-work)
- [Settings to adjust](#settings-to-adjust)

**Note:** The dev stuff is not listed here as there is an own [article about installing the Dev environment](development-environment-on-mac).
