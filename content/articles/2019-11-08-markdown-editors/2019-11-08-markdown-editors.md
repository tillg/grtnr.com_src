I'm looking for a proper Markdown editor. Here are the usage scenarios and criteria I have in mind:

- I plan to use it as an editor to write my diary. 
- I want the editor to be nice
- I want to see the pictures in the preview (or in the editor itself) right away
- I want support, for example when entering the link to a picture it should show me the picture files in the directory - at least as good as VS Code does it...

Here are the editors I looked at and the **Pros** & **Cons**:

- **[Byword](https://bywordapp.com)**: ðŸ›‘ Doesn't show the pictures in the preview
- **[MacDown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com)**: ðŸ›‘ Â Shows the pictures in the preview, but has no support to enter references to pictures and flickers a lot: It feels as it would redraw the entire page with every character I enter... That's annoying!
- **[Abricotine](https://github.com/brrd/abricotine/tree/master)**: Â Looks nice, it shows the pictures. Pros & Cons: Â  
* **Pro**: I have only one window: Writing and previewing happens in the same panel - which is a nice experienece I think. Â  Â 
* **Pro**: It supports nicely to add pictures: With a proper dialogue, even with shortcuts ðŸ˜œ Â  Â 
* **Pro**: It's Open Source Â  Â 
* **Con**: My Pictures taken from the iPhone show up upside-down. As many apps have this problem I account this to a Mac-specific problem - and it's easy to fix... Â  Â 
* **Con**: It hangs often. Seems to mostly when I open/create a new document.
- **[Notable](https://notable.app)**: ðŸ›‘ Nice on Mac, but no image preview or image insertion support.
- **[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)**: That's a totally diffrent thinhg, will have to find out later...
