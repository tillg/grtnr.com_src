**Work in Progress!!**

I am in process of learning the Swift programming language. I do so by following the fantastic course [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/) by Paul Hudson. It's a fantastic course, covers basic Swift first and then SwiftUI.

When trying to apply my learning to little projects I always have lots of questions coming up, and the most reliable source to look for answers is the course, i.e. it's pages. So I need to search in Paul Hudson's site, more specifically in the pages of his course.

As I also play around with Machine Learning, I planned to build an App that I would call **AskPaul**: enter your question and get answers built by a (local!) RAG system: A system that contains all the pages of the course, in Markdown, chunked and index with it's embeddings. Then search for the relevant chunks for the question at hand and pass it to the LLM together with the question.

## What needs to be done

Here is what I want to achieve:

Given a set of web pages available as Markdown, chunk them into handy sized portions and create their embeddings: A vector (i.e. a series of 512 Double values) that _represents their content_ in a mathematical way.

Given a question (think of something like `In Swift, how can I extend a protocol?`) the system should find the chunks with relevant content by calculating the embedding vector of that question and then compare it to all the chunk's vectors to find the closest one. Those chunks are then passed to the LLM together with the question.

In the _old_ Apple Embedding system that is located in the Natural Language package, the functions to achieve this are easily accessible and very nicely explained in the article [Finding similarities between pieces of text](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/naturallanguage/finding-similarities-between-pieces-of-text).

## The problem

But there is a new kid on the block: [NLContextualEmbedding](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/naturallanguage/nlcontextualembedding). It was introduced in iOS 17/macOS 14 and expanded in iOS 18/macOS 15.

Here is why I want to use the new `NLContextualEmbedding`:

- Captures context: It would make the difference between “river bank” and “investment bank.”. The older `NLEmbedding` didn't make this difference.
- Is multilingual and cross‑lingual: By training on multiple languages simultaneously, the model aligns semantic spaces across languages, so “chien” and “dog” are embedded nearby
- Supports more languages
- Runs entirely on device: The model respects user privacy and works offline. Only small model files are downloaded when needed, and those are cached system‑wide.
- Offers robust API controls: Developers can inspect model properties, manage assets, and integrate embeddings into their own ML pipelines.

What's missing are

- the equivalent of `NLEmbedding`'s `vector(for:)`: Getting a vector for a sentence or a chunk
- the equivalent of `distanceBetweenString:andString:distanceType:`: Getting a measure for the distance between 2 sentences.

What `NLContextualEmbedding` provides is a function `embeddingResult(for: String, language: NLLanguage?) throws -> NLContextualEmbeddingResult`. But if you look into the structure of the `NLContextualEmbeddingResult` you see it creates a vector for every token, so a vector of vectors. Furthermore these vectors are accessed with an iterator: `enumerateTokenVectors(in: Range<String.Index>, using: ([Double], Range<String.Index>) -> Bool)` - which took some thinking and learning for me...

So I went out to build a simple to use tooling that is based on the new `NLContextualEmbedding`, similar to what we have in `NLEmbedding`.

Note that a crucial aspect is performance, as to find the best matching chunks / vectors in a larger set, it takes many comparisons - and my first attempts took many minutes to search...

## Test Data

As I started with the idea of building an on-device RAG system for Paul Hudson's SwiftUI course, here is what I did:

- Scrape the main pages of the SwiftUI course to Markdown
- Chunk them
- Write them all in one JSON file that I can copy in my Swift project

To get this done I plugged together some scripts in [site2chunks](https://github.com/tillg/site2chunks). An example JSON is in my AskPaul project: [merged_chunks](https://github.com/tillg/AskPaul/blob/main/AskPaul/AskPaul/merged_chunks.json)

Based on this I have in my Swift code

- A `struct Chunk`. If you are curious, go see the [code](https://github.com/tillg/AskPaul/blob/main/AskPaul/AskPaul/Chunk.swift) that represents a chunk
- A `Bundle Extension` that reads the chunks from the JSON file ([Code]()). Note: This is of course inspired from [Paul Hudson's course](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/example-code/system/how-to-decode-json-from-your-app-bundle-the-easy-way) 😜

**Note**: I start with just the _main pages_: the entry page of each of the 100 lessons. I do this so the data set is easy to handle and my experiments are fast to run. Once I am done with the experiments I will increase the data set.

## The starting point: `NLEmbedding`

With this test data in place, let's play around with the _old_ `NLEmbedding`.

The rough structure of the code looks like this:

```swift
#Playground
{
    let question = """
        How can I extend a protocol?
    """
    if let sentenceEmbedding = NLEmbedding.sentenceEmbedding(for: .english) {
        if let vector = sentenceEmbedding.vector(for: question) {
            print(vector)
        }
        let distance = sentenceEmbedding.distance(between: question, and: "That is a sentence.")
        print(distance.description)
    }
}
```

Calculating the embedding vector for my 722 chunks on my MacBook Pro takes 35'966 ms ~ 35 seconds or ~ 49 ms / Vector.

The other test is calculating distances between pairs of sentences:

```swift
let distance = sentenceEmbedding.distance(between: chunk1.content, and: chunk2.content)
```

As expected this takes about twice as long, as for every distance calculation 2 embedding vectors have to be calculated: `Calculating 722 distances with NLEmbedding: 70334.78999137878 ms`

Note that if I run the loop calculating the distance always to the same text, it takes almost exactly the same time as just calculating one vector. In other words this loop:

```swift
for chunk in chunks {
    let distance = sentenceEmbedding.distance(between: chunk.content, and: "This is a simple text")
}
```

takes about 36 seconds. This would indicate that calculating the distance between 2 vectors takes very little time...

The last thing I would like to do is to get the `k` closest chunks to a given question. My way of doing thins, is to sort the array of chunks by their distance to our question:

```swift
func findClosest<T: Embeddable>(to question: String, in chunks: [T], k: Int = 3) -> [T] {
        guard let sentenceEmbedding = NLEmbedding.sentenceEmbedding(for: .english) else {
            // Fallback if embedding is unavailable
            return Array(chunks.prefix(k))
        }
        var distanceCalculations = 0
        let sorted = chunks.sorted { lhs, rhs in
            let dl = sentenceEmbedding.distance(between: question, and: lhs.content)
            let dr = sentenceEmbedding.distance(between: question, and: rhs.content)
            distanceCalculations += 2
            return dl < dr
        }
        print("\(distanceCalculations) distance calculations done.")
        return Array(sorted.prefix(k))
    }
```

Finding the closest chunks to a given question (which is equivalent to sorting the array) takes quite long: 1'554'280 ms ~ 1'554 secs ~ 25 MINUTES

Note that we need 11'290 comparisons. As I assume that Apple caches the Vector of the one sentence that is used in every comparison, that means that it used the time for 11'290 x (calculate vector + calculate distance of vectors). Strange enough, this makes ~ 137ms / (calc vector + calc distance)...

An attempt to put our results in an overview:

| Data set: 722 chunks | Calculate 722 vectors | Calculate 722 distances | Sort array of 722 chunks | ms / Vector |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------- |
| NLEmbedding          | 35 sec                | 70 sec                  | 1554 sec                 | 49 ms       |

## Measuring time

As we will measure lots of time slots used by different calculations, I built a little time tracking system. The key thing to understand is how to call it:

```swift
timerTrack("Timer name") {
    // Some code that I want to time here
}
timerReport("Timer name") // Prints out my timer stats
```

Over time my `timerTrack` got more elaborate so it returns the result of it's block, works also in async. So we can do things like this:

```swift
let result = try timerTrack("Embedding") {
    try embeddingResult(for: sentence, language: language)
}
```

## Calculating an embedding vector based on `NLContextualEmbedding` the naive way

Now if we try to do a similar thing using `NLContextualEmbedding`, we first need to do some basic coding: Apple's Contextual Embedding generates a list of vectors, specifically one per token.

So we need to compile them to just one vector. A standard way of achieving this is vector pooling:

[The most common method is mean pooling, where the embeddings of all tokens (excluding padding) are averaged.](https://milvus.io/ai-quick-reference/how-do-sentence-transformers-create-fixedlength-sentence-embeddings-from-transformer-models-like-bert-or-roberta)

Imagine you have 2 3-dimensional vectors `v1` and `v2`, and want to calculate their mean vector `v3`:

```swift
v3.x = (v1.x + v2.x) / 2;
v3.y = (v1.y + v2.y) / 2;
v3.z = (v1.z + v2.z) / 2;
```

It would be an easy loop through the dimensions, and for every dimension calculate the average of all the components of the vectors. Now we face a little technicality, and that's how `NLContextualEmbedding` delivers us the vectors, wrapped in a `NLContextualEmbeddingResult`. If you look up the [docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/naturallanguage/nlcontextualembeddingresult) here is what they say:

```swift
func enumerateTokenVectors(in: Range<String.Index>, using: ([Double], Range<String.Index>) -> Bool)
# Iterates over the embedding vectors for the range you specify.
```

For me this was tricky, but this is what (I think) it boils down to:

You give it a `Range<String.Index>` to indicate from where to where you want the vectors listed. Why did they not simply use something like `0...10`? The secret is, that the `Range<String.Index>` is not going through the text like `T`, `h`, `ì`, `s`, `_`, `i`, `s`... but through the **tokens**.

Let's inspect what the toekns actually look like:

```swift
result.enumerateTokenVectors(in: result.string.startIndex..<result.string.endIndex) { vector, range in
    let token = result.string[range]
    print("Vector for token [\(token)]")
    return true // Return true to keep enumerating, false to stop early
}
```

This is what we get:

```text
Vector for token []
Vector for token []
Vector for token [This]
Vector for token [is]
Vector for token [a]
Vector for token [sentenc]
Vector for token [e]
Vector for token [.]
```

Seeing this, it makes sense that the index is just counting from 1 to the `string.count`, but is a bit of a more complex beast.

You already saw how to use the second argument of our `enumerateTokenVectors` function: The `using`-closure with a signature of `([Double], Range<String.Index>) -> Bool`. That basically means you give it an array of `Double` (yes, this is finally our vector 😜) and a String index and return a `Bool`: `true` if you want it to continue, `false` if you want it to stop.

With this in mine, let's write a function that caclculates the average of our vectors that are inside a `NLContextualResult`:

```swift
func getMeanVectorNaive(result: NLContextualEmbeddingResult) -> [Double]? {
    var sumVector: [Double]? = nil
    var count = 0
    result.enumerateTokenVectors(in: result.string.startIndex..<result.string.endIndex) { vector, _ in
        if sumVector == nil {
            sumVector = vector
        } else {
            precondition(sumVector!.count == vector.count, "All vectors must have the same length")
            for i in 0..<sumVector!.count {
                sumVector![i] += vector[i]
            }
        }
        count += 1
        return true
    }

    // Check that we are not facing an empty arry of vectors - avoid div by 0
    guard var sumVector = sumVector, count > 0 else {
        print("getMeanVectorNaive: No token vectors to average")
        return nil
    }

    let divisor = Double(count)
    for i in 0..<sumVector.count {
        sumVector[i] /= divisor
    }
    return sumVector
}
```

I guess now this code is pretty straight forward:

- We set our `sumVector` and `count`
- Then we call the `enumerateTokenVectors` with a closure that adds the value of each vector to the `sumVector` and increase the counter by +1 for every vector
- Then we divide every component of the sumVector by the number of vectors we initially had,
- ...and we surround this by some guards for avoiding division by zero.

Note that in my code base I wrapped this as extensions to `NLContextualEmbeddingResult`.

Before we measure the timing of our naive mean pooling, let's see how long it takes to just calculate the embedding vectors with `NLContextualEmbedding`:

Calculating 722 embeddings with `NLContextualEmbedding` (w/o compiling them to their mean) takes 5245 ms ~ 5,2 seconds.

To put it into relation, let's add this to our overview table:

| Data set: 722 chunks                       | Calculate 722 vectors | Calculate 722 distances | Sort array of 722 chunks | ms / Vector |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------- |
| NLEmbedding                                | 35 sec                | 70 sec                  | 1554 sec                 | 49 ms       |
| NLContextualEmbedding (Just the embedding) | 5 sec                 |                         |                          | 7,26 ms     |

Wow! It takes 7x less time to calculate the embeddings with the more modern `NLContextualEmbedding`, even though this one produces not one but many vectors per chunk!

Up net, let's calculate the compiles mean vector for all of our 722 chunks: 17118 ms ~ 17 seconds

| Data set: 722 chunks                          | Calculate 722 vectors | Calculate 722 distances | Sort array of 722 chunks | ms / Vector |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------- |

| NLContextualEmbedding (Just the embedding)    | 5 sec                 |                         |                          | 7,26 ms     |
| 🔆 NLContextualEmbedding & mean pooling naive | 17 sec                |                         |                          | 23,71 ms    |

## Calculating Cosine similarity the naive way

Now if we have 2 sentences, we calculate their embedding vectors, how do we get their _distance_? Enters **[cosine similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity)**.

Imagine you have two arrows that start at the same point.

- Each arrow shows a direction and how long it is.
- If the arrows point in exactly the same direction, they are very similar.
- If one arrow points the opposite way, they are completely different.
- If the arrows are side by side at a right angle (like an “L”), they are not similar at all — they don’t point toward each other.

Cosine similarity is a number that tells us how much two arrows point the same way:

- If they point the same way, cosine similarity = 1 (super similar 🥰)
- If they point at 90°, cosine similarity = 0 (not similar 😐)
- If they point opposite ways, cosine similarity = -1 (totally different 😠)

Now we rather want something that expresses a notion of distance. We call this **cosine distance**.

`Cosine distance = 1 − cosine similarity`

That means:

- If two things are exactly the same, cosine similarity = 1 → distance = 0
- If they are completely unrelated, similarity = 0 → distance = 1
- If they are opposite, similarity = -1 → distance = 2

And now Math refresher: When we have 2 vectors, we can easily calculate their cosine.

Say you have two vectors:

- A = [a₁, a₂, …, aₙ]
- B = [b₁, b₂, …, bₙ]

The cosine similarity between them is:

$$
\text{cosine} = \frac{A \cdot B}{\|A\| \times \|B\|}
$$

- where $A \cdot B$ is the dot product $A \cdot B = a₁b₁ + a₂b₂ + … + aₙbₙ$
- and the magnitude is $||A|| = \sqrt{a₁² + a₂² + … + aₙ²}$

Putting this into code the naive way:

```swift
func cosineSimilarityNaive(_ a: [Double], _ b: [Double]) -> Double? {
    guard a.count == b.count, !a.isEmpty, !b.isEmpty else {
        return nil // vectors must have same size and not be empty
    }
    let dotproduct = 0.0
    var firstSquared = 0.0
    var secondSquared = 0.0
    for i in 0..<a.count {
        dotproduct += a[i] * b[i]
        firstSquared += a[i] * a[i]
        secondSquared += b[i] * b[i]
    }
    let normA = sqrt(firstSquared)
    let normB = sqrt(secondSquared)

    guard normA > 0 && normB > 0 else {
        return nil
    }
    return dotproduct / (normA * normB)
}
```

Now with this in place we can calculate the 722 distance with our naive implementation: This takes us 34306 ms ~ 34 sec

Now we sort our array by using this distance function: this takes us 717983 ms ~ 717 sec. Still twice as fast as the old `NLEmbedding` - and we haven't started tuning yet! 😜

| Data set: 722 chunks                          | Calculate 722 vectors | Calculate 722 distances | Sort array of 722 chunks | ms / Vector |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------- |
| NLEmbedding                                   | 35 sec                | 70 sec                  | 1554 sec                 | 49 ms       |
| NLContextualEmbedding (Just the embedding)    | 5 sec                 |                         |                          | 7,26 ms     |
| 🔆 NLContextualEmbedding & mean pooling naive | 17 sec                | 34 sec                  | 717 sec                  | 23,71 ms    |

Now let's look into some optimization...

## Reducing embedding vector calculations

The first thing that jumps into our face is that in our code we calculate the same vectors over and over. We had to do this using `NLEmbedding`, because it was all packaged and provided by Apple - we probably also benefitted from their internal tuning. Now that we built out our own tooling, we are open to optimize this.

You maybe noticed that we packaged our content string in `Chunk` structs, and those structs conform to the `Embeddable` protocol. This protocol gives us a standard way of accessing the string that should be embedded via the variable `content`:

```swift
protocol Embeddable: Identifiable {
    var content: String { get }
}
```

You might notice it also extends the `Identifiable` protocol, and that's what I will use here: I will build an `EmbeddingStore` that remembers the embedding to a chunk by using the chunk's `id`:

```swift
actor EmbeddingStore {
        init(model: NLContextualEmbedding) {...}
        func loadChunks(_ newChunks: [Chunk]) async {...}
}
```

What it basically does is calculating the embedding vectors for chunks and then using them to get a distance and to sort them all. The only tricky part is the `async` side: using `NLContextualEmbedding` is async, so we do it all at the beginning and then use the pre-calculated vectors when sorting - w/o any `async` burden by that time. We also shift the work around actors a bit... The benefit is impressive:

| Data set: 722 chunks                                              | Calculate 722 vectors | Calculate 722 distances | Sort array of 722 chunks | ms / Vector |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------- |
| NLEmbedding                                                       | 35 sec                | 70 sec                  | 1554 sec                 | 49 ms       |
| NLContextualEmbedding (Just the embedding)                        | 5 sec                 |                         |                          | 7,26 ms     |
| NLContextualEmbedding & mean pooling naive                        | 17 sec                | 34 sec                  | 717 sec                  | 23,71 ms    |
| 🔆 NLContextualEmbedding & mean pooling naive w/ cached distances | 17 sec                | 74 ms ~ 0,074 sec       | 1 ms                     | 23,71 ms    |

That basically means that calculating the cosine similarity by multiplying vectors is super cheap, even the naive way. And sorting them once the distances have been calculated is almost free 😜

I had in mind some other tuning measures that I will postpone, as the cosine calculation is so cheap. Here is what I thought of initially:

**Tuning by using Matrix calculation**: Apple offers the [Accelerate Framework](https://developer.apple.com/accelerate/) that provides very fast vector and matrix operations. In our case we could improve the cosine similarity calculations. Based on [Apple's explanations](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/718/) I would expect that we could make it ~3x faster.

**Tuning by using normed vectors**: Currently we calculate the cosine similarity like this:

$$
\text{cosine} = \frac{A \cdot B}{\|A\| \times \|B\|}
$$

If we would use normed vectors of length 1, we could avoid the division by the product of their length and would end up with

$$
\text{cosine} = {A \cdot B}
$$

Maybe we will revisit once we have larger data sets.

## Extending the data set

Now that the experiment runs within reasonable time with the test data set, let's expand it to our real data set. If we scrape the site www.hackingwithswift.com more extensively and chunk the markdown files we get, we end up with 21'730 chunks. Let's play around with this data set and run our last process: Loud them in our `EmbeddingStore`, which basically means we calculate their vectors by running `NLContextualEmbedding.embeddingResult` and then calculate the mean vector - still in our naive way. And then we calculate the distance of every of our vectors to the vector of our question and we sort by this distance. Here are the results:

| Data set: 21'730 chunks    |                     |
| -------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Calculating vectors        | 487,967 sec ~ 8 min |
| Calculating distances      | 2,165 sec           |
| Sorting based on distances | 49 ms               |

Pay attention to the units when reading this table! 😜

8 minutes to calculate the vectors of our 21' chunks. These are the actions that come to mind:

- How much of this time is used to create the Embedding vectors? And how much is compiling these vectors to one with our mean vector calculation?
- Since these vectors stay the same for our data set (unless we change the Embedding Model), we should definitely save them.

So if we look into the `NLContextualEmbedding.vectorNaive` function, we see the following time consumptions:

```
⏱️ [Embedding] count=21730  total=158.623341s  avg=7.300ms
⏱️ [MeanVector] count=21730  total=329.307913s  avg=15.155ms
```

As we can't speed up the Embedding creation (if you have an idea, drop me an email!), let's look at the mean vector calculation: As we described earlier it basically sums up a list of vectors and then divides it by the no of vectors so it get's the average. Time to unpack the [Accelerate Framework](https://developer.apple.com/accelerate/)!

## Todo

- Reference Code base by deep links into Github
- Modify timing to run the experiments around 100x and calc average in order to get reliable data
