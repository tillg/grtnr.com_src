excerpt: Life is good because I can cycle to work ðŸ˜œ
---

Another reason why life is good: I can cycle to work (almost) every day. It's up to me wether I do it or not. Wether I think the weather is too bad, to cold, to wet - or wether I just put on my rain gear and do it anyways. 

And the best way to find out if something is worth doing it, is by checking how it feels not to do it. So I did: I didn't cycle to work for almost a week. And it felt crap. The first day after the non-cycling week that I picked up my bike again felt great! Fresh air, moving and getting oxygen throughout the entire body, having cold fingers and a hot body...

Bottom line: It might feel difficult at days, but it's worth it: EVERY TIME I move I feel better than if I don't. What an easy take-away ðŸ˜œ
