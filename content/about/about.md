This is the website of Till Gartner. I'm a simple guy with simple hobbies, like

- My **family** and **kids**
- My business (I'm a manager in a really cool software company called [**mgm technology partners**](https://mgm-tp.com)
- Some **sport**: Skiing, running, swimming, climbing.
- Some **programming** (yes, even though by now I rather manage IT than code): Play around with stuff that is new to me. 
- Even thow I don't really cook (there is no point trying to compete with my wife! 🥰), I collect some [recipes](/recipes).

Find me on <a href="https://x.com/tillg" target="blank"><img src="x.svg" alt="X" width="20"/></a>
