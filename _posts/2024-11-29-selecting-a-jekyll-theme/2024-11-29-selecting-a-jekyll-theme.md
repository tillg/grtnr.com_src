excerpt: It's been a while that I haven't worked on my site. Now I upgraded to the up-to-date technical tools - and as usual the theme is being reworked again...

Themes that I looked at with my working notes.

## Hydejack

**Current** as of Nov 2024.

![hydejack](hydejack.jpg)
[Hydejack](https://hydejack.com) is my current theme (as of Nov 2024). It looks nice, but

* It has too many bells & whistles - yes, taste changes over time
* I got fed up with the entry page that I have to slide left

## al-folio
**Rejected** b/o too complex.

[al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) looks good - with the picture of Einstein. It looks far less attractive with my face, it has too many areas I don't need. I played around with it (i.e. created a little personalized demo), and it feels complex.
