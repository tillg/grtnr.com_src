During my holiday week I played around with [D3 js](https://d3js.org/). I was fascinated by D3 since the first time I saw it, but I never had time to really play with it. Now I did - a little bit...

My sample data was the number of kilometers I drove with my Vespa in Đà Nẵng over time. I tracked this data by making a _screen shot_ of my km counter from time to time. So I just flipped thru my photo gallery and looked for pictures of my tachometer. I entered the data in a [plain text file](/assets/playgroundd3/vespa.tsv). The I followed some tutorials and tinkered around until I got a curve the way I wanted it.

See my final page [here](/assets/playgroundd3/sample2.html) and the way on how I got there [here](/assets/playgroundd3/index.html).
