**TL;DR In order to record the screen of your Mac together with the sound (i.e. a Zoom session) you can use Soundflower.**

Here is what I wanted to achieve: Make a (video) recording of what is happening on the screen of my Mac **including the sound**. All this, while still hearing what is happening at the same time. In my case I wanted to record a Zoom-Class, but I guess this is a setup that might be useful in many situations.

macOS comes with a great built-in screen recording tool:[ QuickTime Player](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208721) (yes, it records, even though the name says *player* ðŸ˜€). 

When using QuickTime Player the only problem is the sound: The choices you have are *Internal Microphone* or *None*. That fits well if you want to record a tutorial where the sound is what you explain through the microphone, but it doesn't fit my situation.

This is where [SoundFlower](https://github.com/mattingalls/Soundflower) comes in the picture. It's Open Source, mature and reliable (tested by me and far more experienced fellows - and always got very good reviews). SoundFlower as it is today (that's Summer 2020) is not a program with a User Interface, but only a MacOS system extension. That's something you don't see as a user but that is very helpful in the background.

What it does in our case: It creates a new, virtual sound channel that splits the sound stream into 2 other streams. In my case it means that in my Zoom session I select a virtual output instead of the speaker of my Mac. I called this output *MacSpkr_SndFlwr*. And this virtual stream splits the output to the Speaker of the Mac and the (logical) SoundFlower channel. Then I select the SoundFlower channel as input to my QuickTime Player Recording and that's it.

## Setting it all up 

**Installing Soundflower **is well described on it's [download page on Github](https://github.com/mattingalls/Soundflower/releases/tag/2.0b2). The process might seem a bit clumsy but works well if you follow it step by step. Note that it took me a while to figure out what they meant by "*Once there, there should be an "Allow" button (**) that you will need to click on to give permission to use Soundflower (developer: MATT INGALLS).*" I was expecting a popup dialog with the Allow-button, but it's simply a button within the window.

Also note that you need to reboot your Mac after installing Soundflower.

Once you have Soundflower installed you can create a logical Audio Device that will be slipping the sound stream. To do so, open* Audio MIDI Setup*. It is a macOS utility program located in /Applications/Utilities. You can also start it via Spotlight (hit Cmd + Space) and enter "*Audio Midi"*

*Starting the Audio MIDI Setup via Spotlight*

Once you are in the Audio MIDI Setup program, create a new (logical) Audio Device: hit the "**+**" button in the bottom left corner and select "*Create Multi Output Device*". In the the panel that appears on the right, select "*MacBook Speaker*" AND "*Soundflower (2ch)*".

Then launch your QuickTime Player (this one comes pre-installed on your Mac) and create a new Screen Recording: Menu *File âž¡ New Screen Recording*. In the lower part of the screen a floating menu appears:

Open the Options list and select "Soundflower (2ch)" as input for the recording. Click on "Record" and off you go: Now start your Zoom session, maximize the window and your entire Zoom session will be recorded in a .mov file.

I hope this instructions were helpful; feel free to ask questions if you have any.
