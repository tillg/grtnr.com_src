For a side project I would like to have a nice, moving SVG Logo. While searching for tutorials, I found a couple that might be helpful:

- **[Building shapes in d3.js](https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/shape.html)**, from d3-graph-gallery.com
- **[clipâ€‹Path](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/clipPath)**, on the Mozilla site.
- **[SVG Path Tutorial](http://xahlee.info/js/svg_path_spec.html)**, an old, but very well presented tutorial on SVG. The Path is just one part, but an interesting one...

For my personal design (i.e. what I want to design), this [Google Maps Pin as SVG](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/Google_Maps_pin.svg) is also helpful:

And this is what I built (V1 from May 24th 2019 - subject to change ðŸ˜€)
