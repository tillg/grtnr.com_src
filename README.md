## 2025-05-19: First steps

- Installed Pelican using `pip install pelican`.
- Created a new Pelican project using `pelican-quickstart`.
- Played around with settings in order to have the article markdown file next to the images. In order to get this I need to
  - Change the directory names of the articles to not have the date in it.
- I also added a plugin that generates the title based on the filename: `auto_title.py`.

## 2025-04-21: get the theme
