# playground_pelican

Playing around with [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) static site generator, as announced in my [article](https://grtnr.com/2025-04-18-digital-garden.html).

## Get things up & running

In order to get things running

- Make sure you have Python installed. I work with Python 3.12
- Install the requireed packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Build it: `pelican`
- In the dev process, you probably want to run it, keep it watching file changes and serve the website: `pelican -r -l`

To work in a Github Codespace, start a Codespace and build it with `pelican`.

## Log

### 2025-05-19: First steps

- Installed Pelican using `pip install pelican`.
- Created a new Pelican project using `pelican-quickstart`.
- Played around with settings in order to have the article markdown file next to the images. In order to get this I need to
  - Change the directory names of the articles to not have the date in it.
